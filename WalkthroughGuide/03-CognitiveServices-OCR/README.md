Great resources of Intelligence Services for developers without deeper Machine Learning knowledge are [Microsoft's Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/). These are a set of pre-trained Machine Learning APIs across various sections like Vision, Speech or Knowledge that developer's can simply include within their applications using a REST API.

One of these APIs is [Computer Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/), a service that tries to understand what's on a picture or video. This service can analyze pictures to generate tags and captions, detect adult or racy content, read text in images, recognizes celebrities and landmarks, detects faces and emotions and much more. You should definitely take some time to explore and play around with all these services!

# Face Explorer App 
There is a great Angular app (https://github.com/smichelotti/ps-face-api-explorer) built by [Steve Michelotti](https://github.com/smichelotti/ps-face-api-explorer) that can make Face APIs administration quite easy. If you want, you can follow the link and clone it.

> **Note** After you download the code, you need to update (ps-face-api-explorer/src/app/services/face-api-service.service.ts) with your Face API endpoint and subscription key.
